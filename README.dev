** TESTSUITE **

For testing PostgreSQL 9.2 and later, DBD::Pg 2.19.3 is required.

Running the testsuite:

* env -i make test
* LC_ALL=C make test
* initdb and friends not in $PATH: LC_ALL=C make test PGBINDIR=/usr/lib/postgresql/9.2/bin
* Run a single test: LC_ALL=C make test TEST_FILES=t/02_database_size.t
* Skip network tests: LC_ALL=C make test SKIP_NETWORK_TESTS=1

The testsuite is sensitive to locale and PG environment variables such as LANG
and PGDATABASE. Using `env -i` will unset all variables from the user
environment for running the tests.
